Welcome to the repository for the Vintage Express Management Website!

HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the foundation of all web pages. It defines the structure and content of a web page, telling browsers how to display text, images, links, and other elements.

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. Think of it like the paint, wallpaper, and furniture that transform a drab house into a vibrant home. It's how you tell your web page what to wear, how to lay things out, and how to impress your visitors.

JavaScript (JS) is a powerful programming language that brings web pages to life. It's the third pillar of web development, alongside HTML and CSS.
